=============================

## Personal information 
I was born on August 28th, 1995. I'm 25 years. 
My goal is to learn how to create sites of varying complexity. I like to create something unusual.
Basic information comes from my self-study. I consider this element of training a priority.I believe that courses help in this matter.
I have always been attracted by interestingly designed websites and applications. I thought it was something unattainable for an ordinary person. 
But I also decided to try to create something similar. I really liked this process. Now I want to learn more every day.
